# Master's thesis typst template for Aalto University (WIP)

This is a template for a master's (or bachelor's) degree in aalto, made with typst. It is not fully ready, and support will be offered based on a voluntary basis, as time and availability allow. 


## Compatibility
NOTE: As of typst v. 0.12.0, the compiler does not support PDF-A, Which is required by Aalto. To fix this, you have to use GhostScript (or similar) to convert the final document

For GhostScript users, you can use this command: `gs -dPDFA=2 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sProcessColorModel=DeviceCMYK -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFACompatibilityPolicy=1 -sOutputFile="C:\path\to\OUTput.pdf" "C:\path\to\INput.pdf"`
